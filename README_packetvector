Packetvector

Packetvector is based on Packetspammer by Andy Green <andy@warmcat.com>

Packetvector sends crafted 802.11 packets through mac80211.  Unlike packetvector,
it doesn't listen, it only transmits.

The packets aren't fully correct, they simply have properly set 802.11 headers.
For example, a beacon vector doesn't have proper information elements, just the
data "Vectorspammer".  This should be corrected in the future but for now it was
expediant and fulfuilled the testing requirement.  

Packetvector is used as follows:
packetvector [-v #] mon0 

Packetvector must be called with the interface to transmit on.  It is designed 
to transmit on a monitor interface.  

An optional vector number can be given by the -v flag. If the vector flag isn't 
specified, packetvector will cycle through all of the defined vectors repeatedly.
If it is given, Packetvector will spam the specified vector over and over as 
fast as possible.

Currently the following vectors are defined:
0	Data
1	Null
2	Beacon
3	Probe Response
4	Probe Request

Transmitted vectors can be viewed using Wireshark or another sniffer.  In 
Wireshark, the appropriate headers can be views, but it will mark the Beacon,
Probe Response and Probe Request packets as invalid as their data payloads
aren't properly formed.  Data and Null are correct however.

Typical usage:
iw dev wlan0 interface add mon0 type monitor
iwconfig wlan0 channel 6
iwconfig mon0 channel 6
ifconfig mon0 up
./packetvector mon0
